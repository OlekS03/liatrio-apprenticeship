# liatrio-apprenticeship

## Overview
This project is a part of the **Liatrio Apprenticeship Interview Exercise**, which demonstrates the ability to build, containerize, test, and deploy a simple web application using modern DevOps tools and workflows.

The application is a **Golang web service** built with the [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) framework. It exposes a single HTTP endpoint (`/`) that returns a **minified JSON object** containing the developerâ€™s name and the current timestamp.
